## Introduction
This project focuses on leveraging Python for data analysis. It includes data cleaning, processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from datasets and present them in an understandable format. This project is designed for both beginners and advanced users aiming to sharpen their data analysis skills.

## Features
- Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
- Data Visualization: Create plots and dashboards using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Automation: Scripts for repetitive data analysis tasks.
- Export Results: Save processed data and visualizations for reporting.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-python.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd data-analysis-python

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Load Your Dataset
Replace `data.csv` with your dataset file in the `data/` directory.

### Step 2: Run the Analysis Script
```bash
python analyze.py
```
### Step 3: View Results
Results will be saved in the `results/` directory and visualizations will open in your browser.
